Probably, with the vaccination campaigns in place, we will return to the office. Therefore, I'm looking for a new apartment in Milan and I would like to use this opportunity to practice my learnings in Coursera, particularly with Foursquare, in order to answer the relevant questions arisen.\nThe key question that I would address whitin this project is the following: How can I find a convenient and enjoyable place that fit my interests?\nIn order to make a comparison and an evaluation of the rental option, below is a list of some \"constraints\" based on what I am looking for:\n- Apartment must be one or two room flat\n- Desired location is near a metro station within 1km radius\n- Price of rent not exceed \u20ac1,200 per month\n- Nice to have venues such as gym, food shops and restaurants\nFinding an apartment in Milan is always an hard job, especially for one and two rooms flats. Therefore, I believe that this work could be useful first for helping me to find a solution and, in general, for anyone moving to other large city in Italy. \n\n### 2. Data description \n___\nTo empirically investigate the research question identified in this study, the following data is required:\n- List of Boroughs and Neighborhoods of Milan with their geodata (latitude and longitude)\n- List of Subway metro stations in Milan with their address location\n- List of apartments for rent in Milan including their price\n- List of venues for each neighbor "
